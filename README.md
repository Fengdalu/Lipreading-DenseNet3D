## Introduction   

This respository is implementation of the proposed method in [LRW-1000: A Naturally-Distributed Large-Scale Benchmark for Lip Reading in the Wild](). Our paper can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.06990.pdf).

## Dependencies
* Python 3.6.7   
* PyTorch 1.0+
* Others
## Dataset
This model is pretrained on LRW with RGB lip images(112Ã—112), and then tranfer to LRW-1000 with the same size. We train the model end-to-end.   
## Training And Testing
You can train or test the model as follow:
```
python main.py options_lip.toml
```
Model architecture details and data annotation items are configured in `options_lip.toml`. Please pay attention that you may need modify the code in `options_lip.toml` and change the parameters `data_root` and `index_root` to make the scripts work just as expected.
